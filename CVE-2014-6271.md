>**The Log4j vulnerability CVE-2021-44228, aka “Log4Shell.”** When Log4Shell outputs the log, the log is not only written with message data, but also automatically accesses the directory service using JNDI. By doing so, It may provide a function of converting to a name or downloading a Java object. The attacker exploits this function to connect the victim server to the attacker server to download malicious Java objects. As a result, the malicious code can be used to steal server privileges.
